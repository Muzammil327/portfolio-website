In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps of creating a Next.js application. Next.js is a widely used React framework that facilitates server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and easy client-side routing. Therefore, it is an excellent option for developing contemporary web applications.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

> Before we begin, make sure you have Node.js and [npm](https://npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the [official Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website if you haven't already.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

> If you want to create a new project, you'll need to give it a name. To get started, there's a command you can use that will generate a new folder with the name you choose. Inside the folder, a basic structure for your project will be set up using Next.js.
> On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```bash
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

> After you create your project, you'll need to use a program called "terminal" to navigate to the project folder. Once you're in the folder, you can start working on your project by running a command that will start a "development server". This server is like a tool that helps you see the changes you make to your project in real-time as you work on it.

```bash
cd my-next-app  // replace with own project name
npm run dev
```

This command will launch a development server and open your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application in a web browser. You can now start editing the source files, and any changes you make will be automatically reflected in the browser.

> Open page.tsx in app or page and replace its contents with the following code:

```bash
function Home() {
  return <div>Welcome to your Name!</div>;
}

export default Home;

```

#### Conclusion

You've just made your first Next.js application from scratch. In this article, we learned how to set up a development environment for Next.js and create a new project. This is just the start of your Next.js journey, and there's still much more to discover and learn.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
