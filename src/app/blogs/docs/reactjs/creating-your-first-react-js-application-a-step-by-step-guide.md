In today's rapidly evolving web development landscape, creating dynamic and performant web applications is more important than ever. Next.js, a popular React framework, offers a powerful solution for building server-rendered React applications with ease. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of creating your first Next.js application, covering everything from project setup to deployment.

Before diving into Next.js development, you'll need to set up your development environment. Start by installing Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager), on your system. Once Node.js is installed, you can use npm to create a new Next.js project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Replace "my-next-app" with the name you want to give to your project. This command will generate a new directory with the specified name and set up a basic Next.js project structure inside it.

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```bash
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

> Once your project is created, navigate into the project directory using the terminal and run the following command to start the development server:

```bash 
cd my-next-app  // replace with own project name
npm run dev
```

This command will launch a development server and open your Next.js application in a web browser. You can now start editing the source files, and any changes you make will be automatically reflected in the browser.

> Open page.tsx in app or page and replace its contents with the following code:

```bash
function Home() {
  return <div>Welcome to your Name!</div>;
}

export default Home;

```

You can access any element of an array using its variable name and square brackets to index the specific element you want to retrieve.

#### Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully created your first Next.js application from scratch. In this article, we covered the basics of setting up a Next.js development environment, creating a new Next.js project, understanding pages in Next.js, and adding navigation to your application. Armed with this knowledge, you're now ready to explore the full potential of Next.js and build powerful, server-rendered React applications. Happy coding!
